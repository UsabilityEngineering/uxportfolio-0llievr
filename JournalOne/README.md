This is a multi-fit bottle cap that works on practically any bottle. It allows the user
safely and securely re-cap any bottle that doesn’t already have a replaceable cap. My user experience with this product was very pleasant. I had never seen any type of cap like this before so I didn’t really know what it was before I started messing around with it. To my surprise it is very **Learnable**, meaning it has characteristics that let a user know what it is by its design. All you had to do was push the cap down on the bottle and the spring on the inside would automatically adjust to make a seal while the arms on the outside effortlessly clamped onto the side of the bottle. The only draw back to the design is it is not as durable as a screw on cap, it is mostly meant to keep air out and preserve the flavor of whatever is inside the bottle. To fix this issue the manufacturer could incorporate a folding lock so the arms can’t be accidentally knocked open.
